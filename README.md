## Open Payments data

Since 2014 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid have been collecting, validating and publishing  payments made by pharmaceutical companies or medical device manufacturers to teaching hospitals, doctors, and starting in 2021 physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other health care providers who are not employed by the entity making the payment.

Payments can take various forms:
* Cash or cash equivalent
* Dividends, profit or other return on investment
* In-kind items and services
* Stock options
* Other ownership interest

In-kind and cash or cash equivalent are the most common, though the most money is spent on.

Physicans recieve these benefits much more frequently than teaching hospitals. Just shy of 850,000 physicians and about 4,000 teaching hosptials have received some sort of payment.
